# Brain Tumor Visualization

![Brain Tumor](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/NastyConcreteAgama-size_restricted.gif)

The location and extent of a brain tumor is critical to understanding the
symptoms to expect and to form a treatment strategy. This visualization
unveils a large tumor in the right, frontal lobe. Blood vessels, which are
landmarks and criticial structures to avoid during surgery, have been enhanced
in this magnetic resonance image. The tumor is highlighted through
segmentation in this gradient-based volume rendering. Generated with
